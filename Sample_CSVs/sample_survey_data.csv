I was able to work in an effecttive team and benefitted greately from this.||Awful class. I learnied absolutely nothing. My team made me do all the work while they played video games. Teacher made fun of me for being bad.||I now question the implications behind my existence and why I even choose to suffer after going through this. What does it mean to truly learn anymore?||No comment||Rose shouldn't even offer this class. Nobody I know got anything out of it. Horrible||While the prof was really good, I think that there was a huge lapse in the material covered. We did some cool, useful stuff, but some of the projects seemed really out of place or disjointed with the rest of the class."
Mario,Speedwagon,2019-2020 Spring Quarter Course Evaluations,MA114-01,Calculus 4,104220-9164,226883-0,22,19,0.863636,0,0,0,19,100,"This class is completely pointless in my opinion. I feel like I haven't learned anything new in the last 10 weeks and it makes me angry to feel like I'm wasting my money for 10 weeks of busy work.||I enjoyed this class very much. I enjoyed the concepts that I learned in the first three calculus classes, but my level of understanding wasn't at the level I wanted to be at. This class helped me round out those skills and taught me a lot about the useful strategies to solve difficult problems.||Great class. Awesome professor who was always available to help when needed. The homework assignments were a good length, and the exams reflected the content we learned throughout the course.||I learned a lot because the professor is the best professor I've had since I've been at this school.||The structure of this class is not good for learning. The lectures are way too long and the professor is always busy with students during the office hours so I never get the help I need.||Great class. I have no complaints"
